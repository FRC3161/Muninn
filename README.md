# Scouting-App

## Building and Running
If you're just looking for binaries, those will be available soon, but if you want 
to contribute or use the latest changes, first set up the expo CLI as per the instructions at https://expo.io/learn.

After that, clone/download the repository and run `expo install` to set everything up. After
that you can run the app with `npm start`
